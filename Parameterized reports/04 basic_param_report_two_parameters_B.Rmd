```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This is a code space

We can use parameters as a variable inside code chunks

```{r parameters example}
params$country
```

## This is a markdown space 

We can also use **parameters** inside r executable code. 

In this instance, this text after semicolon is populated by the parameter: `r params$country`

The end of the above line is populated by the parameter defined in the YAML section contents.

## Using second parameter

In the YAML section we can define as many parameters as we want, for instance, I am using this time two paramters: country and data

- This report is for metrics from : **`r params$country`**
- Corresponds to **`r params$data`** data.
