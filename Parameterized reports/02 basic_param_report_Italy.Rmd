## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## This is a code section

We can use parameters as a variable inside code chunks

```{r parameters example}
params$country
```

## This is a text space

We can also use **parameters** inside r executable code. 

In this instance, this text after semicolon is populated by the parameter: **`r params$country`**

The end of the above line is populated by the parameter defined in the YAML section contents.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
